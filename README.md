# Odin-Project: Flight Booker

This is the [Odin Project Flight Booker](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker) project.

In this project we are building a simple flight booking application in Ruby On Rails.

## Note on Kalendae date picker

This app uses the amazing [Kalendae](https://github.com/Twipped/Kalendae) date picker which requires JavaScript to work.
